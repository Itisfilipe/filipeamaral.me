      <description>I have been working on an app where a user can have multiple projects, and all features should work against the currently selected project. I want to make the project automagically available to the views (all of them) without any hassle and one way to do that is by injecting the project into the request before they hit the view layer. In Django, we can easily accomplish this task by creating a custom middleware.</description>
